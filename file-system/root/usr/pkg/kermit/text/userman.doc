	       I.  Introduction.
	       --  -------------

	 The Kermit file protocol is designed to allow for
     errorless file transfer between different systems.  While
     every system should have a Kermit written for that system
     and designed for the capabilities of that particular system,
     the file transfer should normally not be system-dependent.

	 This document describes the Cromemco Cromix Kermit
     Release 1.32.  It contains only system-specific information;
     for a description of Kermit in general, please see the Kermit
     User Guide. Fifth Edition, Revision 1, on which the present
     version is based.

	 Cromix Kermit Release 1.32 contains all the features of
     standard Kermit, as well as several advanced ones.  Send and
     Receive are fully implemented; options include eight-bit and
     repeat quoting, incomplete file handling, full packet
     debugging, alternate name and wildcard specifications, data
     and text file transmission, bare transmission, transmission
     statistics, timeouts, and flexible send/receive parameter
     setting.


	 The Connect command is also fully implemented, with
     several options such as escape character and line selection,
     automatic baud rate setting, and several line commands.

	 There is also a user-friendly shell, which allows for
     extensive on-line help, many commands, including Remote and
     server commands, as well as a wealth of options to Set and
     several show options which allow one to display several groups
     of options.  A Define command is also available.

	 Finally, there is a server which, while fairly limited, is
     sufficient for file transfer and communication.  The structure
     if Cromix made several common server commands unnecessary, since
     they can also be executed by sending a Remote command to the
     server.

		       Disclaimer.

	 No warranty of the software nor the accuracy of the
     documentation surrounding it is either expressed or implied,

	       II.  Cromix Kermit 1.32 Capabilities.
	       ---  --------------------------------

	 Cromix Kermit Release 1.32 is capable of transferring
     files in one of three modes: text, binary, and image.  It is
     capable of transferring 8-bit data as long as the other
     Kermit is also capable of handling such data.  A brief
     description of the three modes follows.

     2.1.  Text Mode.  Text mode should normally be used to
	   transfer any text or source files.  It allows for more
	   efficient transfer of newlines.

     2.2.  Binary Mode.  While binary mode can be used to
	   transfer any files, it is imperative that it be used
	   to transfer any binary or executable files, since it
	   reproduces the file exactly as submitted.  It is
	   generally a little slower than transferring files in
	   text mode.

     2.3.  Image mode.  Image mode allows one to transfer files
	   which contain eight-bit data without the use of 8-bit
	   prefixing.  This will leave the 8th bit set and will
	   cause problems on much of the communication equipment.
	   While transferring files in image mode may be faster
	   than in either of the other two modes, it is not
	   recommended.

     The default mode is Text; other modes could be set using
     the SET FILE command.  Note that the same mode must be set
     on the other system, unless it can handle file parameters,
     in which case the two Kermits will figure it out between
     themselves.

	 While no exhaustive tests have been done, the speed of
     transfer between two Cromemcos Corvus has averaged around 300
     bytes/sec depending on packet size and file type.

	       III.  The Cromix Kermit 1.32 Shell.
	       ----  -----------------------------

	 When the Kermit command is invoked without arguments,
     the user enters the Kermit Shell, a user-friendly
     environment that is designed to facilitate the use of
     Kermit.  Alternatively, a single Kermit command can be
     issued from Cromix if it is given as an argument on the
     Kermit command line. This is useful for once off invocations
     such as:

	 % kermit set file bin server

	 or

	 % kermit receive


     3.1.  The order of events.  When Kermit is first entered,
	   the Kermit logo is displayed.  Then, the file
	   kermit.ini is executed, if one is present.  Finally,
	   the Kermit prompt appears.  Kermit is now ready to
	   accept commands.

     3.2.  The basics.  The commands can be divided into several
	   categories: control, environment, file transfer,
	   terminal connection, server and server control commands,
	   and on-line help.  Descriptions of commands by category
	   follow.

	   Every shell command is a line containing the command and
	   its arguments separated by spaces, tabs, or commas.
	   Since all input is normally converted to lower case,
	   commands can be entered in either upper or lower case.
	   To enter arguments containing uppercase letters, blanks,
	   commas, or tabs, one should enclose them in double
	   quotes (").  To enter a double quote, two double quotes
	   should be typed in ("").  Note that the quotation
	   character can be altered using the SET QUOTE command
	   (see below).

     3.3.  Control commands.  The following commands are used to
	   control the execution of Kermit and to interface with
	   the Cromix shell.

     3.3.1.  Quit.  The quit command exits the Kermit shell.
	     If a Quit command is entered within a Kermit command
	     file, the control is returned to the controlling
	     Kermit shell or command file.  Exit, Ex, and Stop
	     are abbreviations for the Quit command.

     3.3.2.  Take.  The Take command executes a Kermit command

   Cromix Kermit User Manual                                Page  4



	     file.  If the Take command is invoked with several
	     arguments, it executes all of its arguments serially.
	     T is an abbreviation for this command.

	      Examples :

	       Cromix-Kermit-> t setpars


	       Cromix-Kermit-> take setpars ServCall


     3.3.3.  Shell.  The Shell command executes a shell command or
	     enters a Cromix shell if no arguments are given.
	     Notice that the current version does not allow for
	     the use of wildcards (*, ?, []) in shell command lines.
	     If that is desired, please enter a subsequent shell.
	     Use ex to exit the Cromix shell. Sh or ! is a synonm for
	     this command.

	      Examples :

	       Cromix-Kermit-> sh ls -l


	       Cromix-Kermit-> shell
	       % ls -l
	       % del test.doc
	       % ex
	       Cromix-Kermit->


     3.3.4.  CWD.  The CWD command changes to the directory
	     specified by the argument. Note that it would be
	     useless to enter a shell d command, since, upon return
	     to Kermit, the old directory would be re-entered.  Cd
	     is a synonym for CWD.

	      Examples :

	       Cromix-Kermit-> cwd /usr/etc


	       Cromix-Kermit-> cd filestore


     3.4.  Environment commands.  The environment commands changes
	   or displays the various Kermit parameters.  This
	   includes file transfer parameters as well as several
	   shell options.  One can also define macros which stand
	   for one or more options.  Please refer to section on
	   Kermit Options for a description of the options

   Cromix Kermit User Manual                                Page  5



	   available.

     3.4.1.  Set.  The Set command sets an option or a set of
	     options.  Note that if one wants to specify more than
	     one setting for an option, the option name must be
	     repeated. = is an abbreviation for Set.

	      Example :

	       Cromix-Kermit-> SET DEBUG PACKETS DEBUG STATES.

     3.4.2.  Show.  The Show command displays the setting of an
	     option.  If given with no arguments, it will display
	     all the current settings and all of the defined
	     macros.  One can display only the predefined options
	     by typing in SHOW OPTIONS, while SHOW MACROS will
	     display all of the user-defined macros.  Note that
	     SHOW SEND and SHOW RECEIVE will display all of the
	     set and receive parameters; to display a single
	     parameter from the list, include the parameter after
	     the SHOW command.  More than one option may be
	     displayed with a single Show command; however, under
	     Kermit 1.32, one must be careful to always include an
	     argument to SEND or RECEIVE or place them last in the
	     line. Abbreviations for Show are display, dis, stat,
	     and status.

	      Examples :

	       Cromix-Kermit-> show line


	       Cromix-Kermit-> dis send baud

     3.4.3.  Define.  The Define command is used to define ones
	     own macros.  A Set macro is defined as a list of
	     option names and their settings which could then be
	     set by the use of a single SET command by entering
	     SET <macro name>,  Note that a macro list has to be
	     self-contained; thus, a command SET <macro name>
	     without any additional parameters has to execute
	     properly.  The sequence DEFINE <macro name> will
	     undefine that macro so it could be redefined or the
	     space reused - only 15 macros are allowed.
	     Abbreviations are def and d.


     3.5.  File Transfer Commands.  File transfer commands perform
	   what Kermit is all about - sending or receiving files.

	   Cromix Kermit 1.32 clears the buffers automatically

   Cromix Kermit User Manual                                Page  6



	   prior to the beginning of a file transfer, so as to
	   clear any previous packet traffic still in the buffer.
	   Should the transmission get out of sync during a SEND,
	   if the SYNC option is set, the Kermit will selectively
	   ignore packets as to clear the backlog.

     3.5.1.  Send.  Sends the specified file or files to the
	     other Kermit.  The other Kermit must issue a Receive
	     command, preferably just before the Send.  If no
	     arguments are given, Kermit will ask the user to
	     supply it with the name of the file to send and a
	     name to send it under.  If no name is entered in the
	     latter case, the file is sent under its own name.
	     A wildcard specification may be given in place of a
	     file name. S is an abbreviation for Send.

	      Examples :

	       Cromix-Kermit-> send test


	       Cromix-Kermit-> s
	       send : test
	       as : newtest


	       Cromix-Kermit-> s d*.doc

     3.5.2.  Receive.  Receives file or files from the other
	     Kermit.  If entered with a filename as an argument,
	     it becomes the name of the first file received.
	     R as an abbreviation for Receive.

	      Examples :

	       Cromix-Kermit-> receive


	       Cromix-Kermit-> r next.file

     3.5.3.  Get.  Instructs the remote server to send the
	     specified file or files.  If no arguments are given,
	     Kermit will ask the user for the file name and the
	     file name to receive it under.  A wildcard
	     specification may be entered in the remote server's
	     format if the remote server supports such a function.
	     G is an abbreviation for Get.

	      Examples :

   Cromix Kermit User Manual                                Page  7



	       Cromix-Kermit-> get next.file


	       Cromix-Kermit-> g
	       get : next.file
	       as : new.file


     3.5.4.  Transmit.  Transfers the specified file bare,
	     without protocol.  While its uses are definitely
	     very limited, it could be used for applications such
	     as transferring login sequences. Trans is an
	     abbreviation for Transmit.

	      Example :

	       Cromix-Kermit-> trans start.file

     3.5.5.  Statistics.  Displays the statistics about the last
	     file transfer (transfers done using the TRANSMIT
	     command are ignored).  If the transfer was totally
	     unsuccessful, it says so. Stats is an abbreviation for
	     this command.


     3.6.  Connect.  The connect command can be used to connect
	   over the line to the remote system and start Kermit
	   there or perform any other activity.  An escape
	   character, usually an ^, can be used to break the
	   transmission (<escape character> followed by C), to
	   make sure Kermit is still with you (followed by H), to
	   find out what your options are (followed by ?), to
	   transmit a NULL (followed by 0), or to transmit the
	   escape character itself (followed by itself).  The
	   escape character may be set to another value by
	   entering the SET ESCAPE command. C is an abbreviation
	   for Connect. Note the following:

		Make sure that the correct terminal emulation and
	   baud rate is set, and that the line can be used as a
	   terminal on the remote system.

	   If arguments are given, they are SET as in a SET
	   command.


     3.7.  Server and related commands.  The server should be run
	   in remote mode.  It allows one to control all
	   operations from the local Kermit, without having to
	   switch physically between the two Kermits.  Several
	   commands have been implemented for starting the server

   Cromix Kermit User Manual                                Page  8



	   and controlling it.  Two of them, send and get, are
	   described in the file transfer section, the rest here.

     3.7.1.  Server.  The Server command puts the Kermit into
	     Server Mode.  That means that Kermit is waiting for
	     commands in the form of packets, sending out periodic
	     NAKs to make sure it has not missed a command.  To
	     exit the server without leaving Kermit, issue a local
	     FINISH command or type a Control C. Wildcard sending
	     of files is possible with this version of Kermit.

     3.7.2.  Remote.  The Remote command sends a command to the
	     remote Kermit server in its own interactive language.
	     It takes a number of command strings as arguments.
	     Note, however, that every string consisting of more
	     than one word should be enclosed in the current
	     Cromix Kermit input quotes, so that it could be
	     transferred in one piece. Rem is an abbreviation for
	     this command.

     3.7.3.  Finish.  The Finish command tells the remote Kermit
	     to exit server mode and to return to interactive
	     command processing. Fin is an abbreviation for Finish.

     3.7.4.  Disc.  The Disc command tells the remote Kermit
	     server to exit and log out.

     3.8.  Help.  The Help command prints an online help message.
	   HELP without arguments or HELP HELP will print out a
	   list of commands with short descriptions, while HELP
	   command or command ? will print out a description of
	   that command. While these descriptions may be rather
	   brief and presuppose a basic knowledge of Kermit, they
	   should provide a complete reference on the arguments
	   and the capabilities of a command. One can also type H.

			   IV.  Set Options.
			   ---  ------------

	 The following is a complete list of the options that can
     be used in a Set or a Show command, as well as a list of
     options that may only be used in a Show command.

     4.1.  Line options.  These options are used to specify the
	   physical characteristics of the communication line used.

     4.1.1.  Line.  The full device name of the line is to be
	     entered.  Thus, if we want to connect over qtty3,
	     enter SET LINE /DEV/QTTY3.  The previous line's
	     original setting is restored and the current line is
	     set as per the other parameters.  Line can be
	     abbreviated as L.

     4.1.2.  Baud.  ( B, Baud-rate ) The baud rate desired for
	     communication should be entered.  The legal baud
	     rates are:

		  110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2000,
		  2400, 4800, 9600, 19200  AUTO ( A )
		  and NOCH ( N ).

	     Note that all communications equipment, including the
	     Clearway if it is used, should be set to that baud
	     rate and that if the Cromemco is connected to a
	     remote system through the Connect command, the maximum
	     baud rate that it is advisable to use is 1200 until a
	     way is found to increase the size of the system
	     buffers, which may or may not be possible.

     4.1.3.  Parity.  ( P, Par ) The parity of the other line, which
	     could be:

		 MARK, M            8th bit is 1
		 SPACE, S           8th bit is 0
		 EVEN, E            number of set bits is even
		 ODD, O             number of set bits is odd
		 NONE, NO, N, -     8th bit could be used for
				    data if the system allows
				    it (default)

     4.1.4.  Remote.  ( Rem ) The Remote option, which is a
	     default, can allow one to set the terminal to be the
	     communications line. The old terminal setting is
	     normally saved.  To restore the old setting, type SET
	     REMOTE OFF.  If another option follows REMOTE, use
	     the parameter ON to follow REMOTE.

   Cromix Kermit User Manual                                Page 10



     4.2.  Connect options.  These options control the connect
	   command parameters.

     4.2.1.  Duplex.  ( Dup ) Setting Duplex to HALF (H) will cause
	     the connect command to echo the input.  Most systems
	     do it themselves, hence the default setting is FULL
	     (F), which means that it's up to the remote system to
	     echo the input.

     4.2.2.  Escchr.  ( E, Escape, Esc ) This option allows the
	     connect escape character to be reset . The default is
	     ^, and the argument can be any legal character.  A
	     character not likely to be used on the remote system
	     should normally be selected.


     4.3.  Set/Receive options.  There are two basic categories:
	   options to be invoked with either SEND or RECEIVE
	   preceding them in the argument list (which could be
	   abbreviated as S and R or Rec) and those which do not
	   take that prefix.

     4.3.1.  Options that take the SEND/RECEIVE prefix.  These
	     include:

		PL      Packet length (maximum accepted--at most
			94) (default: 94)
		EOL     End of line--character to be sent after
			the packet is transmitted (default: ^J)
		TO      Timeout--how long to wait got a packet
			before assuming it was lost (default: 10)
		PAD     Number of padding characters to be used -
			useless in all the known implementations
			of Kermit (default: 0)
		PADC    Padding character--the above note applied
			(default: ^@)
		QUOTE   Quotation character to prefix control
			characters (default: #)
		SOP     Start-of-packet character (default: ^A)

     4.3.2.  Delay.  If the terminal is in remote mode (q. v.),
	     wait for the number of seconds specified before
	     transmitting the first packet.  The default is 10.

     4.3.3.  Eight-bit.  ( 8-bit, Eight, 8 )  Eight-bit prefix. The
	     design of Kermit makes both Kermits use the same
	     repeat prefix.  Should not be set to any character
	     whose ASCII value is greater than that of @.  (If you
	     do not know its meaning, leave it.  The default is

   Cromix Kermit User Manual                                Page 11



	     &.)

     4.3.4.  Repeat.  ( Rep )  Repeat prefix.  The note under
	     Eight-bit prefixing applies.  The default is ~.

     4.3.5.  File.  File parameters currently implemented are
	     TEXT, BINARY, and IMAGE.  See section II for a
	     description.

     4.3.6.  Handshake.  ( Hand )  If the other line is half-duplex,
	     it may have to send a turnaround character to indicate
	     that it is ready to receive.  That character is called
	     the handshake and is set with this command.  The
	     following settings are available:

			 XON, ^Q
			 XOFF, ^S
			 CR, RETURN, RET
			 LF, LINEFEED, LINE
			 ESC
			 NONE, NO, N, OFF (default)

     4.3.7.  Retry. ( Ret ) How many times to resend a packet
	     before aborting.  The default is 10.

     4.3.8.  Wild. ( Wildcard ) What the wildcard characters should
	     be.  The keyword ALL (A)  or ONE (O) should follow,
	     followed in turn by the character to use as the send
	     wildcard. The defaults are @ for the string wildcard
	     and ! for the single-characters wildcard.

	     A wildcard is a character that can stand for any
	     number of characters (a string wildcard) or any one
	     character (a character wildcard.)

	      Example :

	       Cromix-Kermit-> send /usr/frog/k@.!

	       will send the following files (assuming they
	       are in the directory).

	       kermit.h
	       kshell.h
	       kermit.1.0.c

     4.3.9.  Sync.  If ON, a Send would be ran with the Pyramid
	     synchronisation scheme.  That scheme ignores packets
	     on even retries which seem to have been generated as
	     a result of a problem with synchronisation.  Unless
	     the connection is really noisy, it is recommended that
	     this option be set, as any synchronisation problems
	     correct themselves very quickly. In fact, Sync is set
	     initially.

     4.3.10.  Warning.  ( Warn ) If this option is set, overwrite
	      protection is on.  In remote mode, no file is
	      overwritten. In local mode, the user is asked whether
	      to overwrite the file prior to proceeding with the
	      transfer.  Warning is set to ON by default.

     4.3.11.  Incomplete. ( Inc ) If this option is set ( ON), as
	      is the default, any incomplete files received are
	      saved. Otherwise, they are deleted.

     4.4.  Shell options.  The following options allow you to
	   set certain shell parameters.

     4.4.1.  Prompt.  ( Pr ) The Kermit prompt.  The default is
	     Cromix-Kermit~>

     4.4.2.  Inq.  ( Input-Quote ) Input quote setting--see the
	     section on the Kermit shell.

     4.4.3.  Debugging ( Debug, D )  Allows one to see what is
	     happening to Kermit.  While this may not be of that
	     much use to most of the Kermit users, it may be
	     appreciated by the support personnel (currently the
	     author of this document) if you could bring a printout
	     of a log of your session with both the PACKETS and the
	     STATES switches on if you encounter any problems. The
	     following options are available:

		   PACKETS, (P)            Packet debug

		   STATES, (S)             Execution debug

		   OFF, (NO, NONE)         No debugging (default)

		   LOG filename,           Log to a file (or OFF to
		    (LOGFILE filename,     send it to the terminal
		     LOG-FILE filename)    (default)

		   NOSTATES,               No execution debug

		    (-S, -STATES,
		     NOSTAT)

		   NOPACKETS,              No packet debug
		    (NOPACK, -PACKETS
		     -P)



     4.5.  Show options.  These are the options that make sense
	   only as arguments of a Show command.  Note that no
	   options at all produces a full listing.

     4.5.1.  Options. ( Set, Settings, =, O, Opt ) Display only
	     the predefined options.

     4.5.2.  Macros. ( M )  Display only the macros (user-defined
	     options).

		   V.  A Sample Session.
		   --  -----------------


     Login to two cromemco and type

	 % kermit

     on both. The finally, the prompt:

	 Cromix-Kermit~>

     Then set the parameters  essential for communication and also
     any desired ones by typing SET then the parameters, such as
     LINE and BAUD. Since LINE is not set by default you must set
     it before starting any file. You can now type

	 SEND <file>

     on one cromemco where <file> is whatever filename you prefer,
     and press return and go to the other computer, where you press
     Receive and a file name if desired when it flashes a box.
     Depending on the packet size and the size of the file the
     transmission should be complete in roughly two minutes.
     When you have finished with Kermit issue the Kermit command

	  STOP


     You are now out of Kermit.

		 VII.  Miscellaneous
		 ----  -------------



	The communication line used for a local Kermit should not
     be defined in the file /ETC/TTYS because this line will be
     regarded as a terminal. Otherwise the file is to be edited and
     the system reset with the command "kill -1 1". Also in the RS232
     interface the pins 4, 5, 6 should be bridged together, and
     likewise pins 8 and 20.
