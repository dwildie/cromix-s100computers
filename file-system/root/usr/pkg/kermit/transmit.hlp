TRANSMIT, TRANS - Transmit a file neat.

		Usage:

		TRANSMIT <file-list>

Transmit files bare, without protocol.  This might be useful as a means of
simulating advanced Kermit 'scripts' (per UUCP).  Thus a transmit file might 
contain the user input to login to a remote system and startup Kermit.  This 
should work provided that the remote machine will cope with type-ahead during 
the login sequence.
