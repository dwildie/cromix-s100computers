Description

The Prompt command changes the system prompt. Prompt_string is the new string
that the Shell is to use as a prompt. It must be a string of up to 23
characters. If no string is specified, the prompt is changed to the default
prompt "user_name[%d]". The new prompt may be any string. For example:

     jim[1] prompt "Yes, dear,"

Note the quotes were used to enforce the whole string to be considered a
single argument. The prompt string may contain the "%d" substring. The "%d"
characters will be replaced by the current command number.

The prompt command inspects the /etc/who file to find the "user_name" of the
user on the current console. The effect is twofold:

- different users with the same user number will get a different prompt.

- execution of the Priv command will not change the prompt as the
  Priv command does not change the /etc/who file.

If there is no /etc/who file or if it does not contain the entry for the
current terminal (this will be true if the user is rooted on a write protected
floppy), the prompt will be "#" or "%", depending on whether or not the user
is privileged.
