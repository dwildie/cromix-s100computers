utility:      MOUNT
purpose:      This program enables access to a file system.

user access:  privileged users

summary:      mount [-r] [devname dummyname]

arguments:    device name

              file pathname

options:      -r    read only

Description

The Mount utility enables access to a file system.

When called without arguments, Mount lists the currently mounted devices.

The Mount utility looks on the disk to be mounted for the file /etc/passwd.
Finding that file, it looks for the special user name mount.  If this name is
present and has a password associated with it, Mount prompts the user for the
password before mounting the disk. Thus, it is possible to protect disks from
being mounted by an unauthorized user.

User Access

By editing the file /etc/mutab, a privileged user can allow selected, non-
privileged users to mount specified devices. The Mount utility consults this
file whenever a non-privileged user gives the Mount command.

Each line in mutab has up to four fields, separated by colons:

          flag :  device :  username :  groupname

Flags can be zero (entry disabled) or one (entry enabled). The device field
must be the name of a block device in the /dev directory.  Username is the
user allowed to mount that device. If groupname is specified (field 4), all
members of that group may mount the device. If username or groupname is not
specified, all users may mount the device.

A typical mutab file is shown here:

          0:fda
          1:fdb :  tom
          1:fdb :  :  users

Line 1:   Because a username or groupname is not specified, any user
          can mount device fda. In the example, this entry is disabled
          by a zero flag in field 1.
Line 2:   User tom may mount device fdb
Line 3:   All members of the users group may mount device fdb.

Options

The -r option causes the file system to be mounted for read-only access.  The
Mount utility will fail if the user tries to mount a write protected device
without the -r option.

Notes

A file system that has been mounted must be unmounted by the use of the
Unmount utility before the mounted disk is removed from the system. If this is
not done, the integrity of the data on the mounted system cannot be assured.

Do not attempt to mount a file system on a nonexistent device. Devices which
do not exist may be deleted from the /dev directory.

Example:

          jim[1] create newfilesys
          jim[2] mount fdb newfilesys
          jim[3] ls -m
          .
          .
          .
          145 D newfilesys

          jim[4]

In the example above, the user first creates a dummy file. After mounting, the
name of this dummy file becomes the root directory name of the file system to
be mounted. After unmounting, this name becomes a dummy filename once again.

The Mount command is given with the device name where the file system is
located. Refer to the _C_r_o_m_i_x-_P_l_u_s _S_y_s_t_e_m _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_o_r'_s _G_u_i_d_e for a complete
list of device names.

The Ls utility shows that the new file system has been mounted and gives the
name of the root directory.
