	to display the next page of this information.

2.      You are now rooted on the updated disk drive and are running
	the newly distributed version of Cromix-Plus. Remove the
	boot floppy from the drive.

3.      Cromix-Plus is distributed in Ftar format and consists of
	a number of volumes.  Run the Update2 command for each floppy

	version of Cromix-Plus.
