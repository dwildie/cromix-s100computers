This is Phase one of Cromix-Plus installation.
Please note the following installation steps.

1.      After you have noted the information on the screen, press any
	key to display the next page of this information.

2.      If the message:

	"Incorrect version of STDC firmware (1.20 or higher required)"

	was displayed during boot procedure, please enter the command "boot"
	to reboot Cromix-Plus. Please see SUDS note Cromix-Plus-1 for details.

3.      The disk on which you plan to install Cromix-Plus must be
	initialized and the file structure must be built on it. (See
	the manuals for the Inithard, Initflop, Makfs utilities).  If
	your disk already has a file system on it, run the Check utility
	to verify the file system integrity. If necessary, run the
	Check -s utility or take any other necessary steps. Do not
	proceed until Check reports no errors.

4.      Run the Update1 command. The argument to Update1 command must
	be the name of your future root device. The Update1 command
	will rename a few files in your future /etc directory (in case
	they exist already) to names with the extension ".old".  If a brand
	new file structure was generated there will be no ".old" files.
	The Update1 command will then Cptree the current file structure
	to the new disk and invoke the Boot command to reboot the system.
	This time you should designate your new disk as the root device.
