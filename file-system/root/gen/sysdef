% list of devices supported and their driver names can be found at
% the end of this file. Each driver can have a number of integer
% arguments. Those arguments, if any, should follow the driver name.
% The arguments must be separated by white space. The number of arguments
% and their meaning depend on the particular driver. See description
% at the end for the arguments a driver might require.
